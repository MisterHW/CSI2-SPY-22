## Raspberry Pi Camera Debugging

Prior work on https://github.com/jergling/MIPI-Spy offers a 15-pin, 1mm pitch PFC bridge PCB with probe points for all signals. RPI CM4 IO BOARD features one, Raspberry Pi 5 boards feature two 4-lane CSI2 camera ports using 22-pin, 0.5mm pitch FFC headers. 

To obtain access to the associated I2C lines and to be able to hook up a logic analyzer, a matching PCB design is provided in this repository.


## 22-Pin FPC Extender With I2C Connections

CSI2-SPY-22 is a 4-layer board that can be populated in multiple variants:
- front-ony: passive PCB with three headers J1, J2, J3.
- back-only: J3, J4, J5 plus [SN65DPHY440SS](https://www.ti.com/product/SN65DPHY440SS) MIPIÂ® CSI-2/DSI DPHY retimer, LDO and passives. 

Re-timers can be used to zero out skew between lanes and re-transmit data with optional pre-emphasis. Please refer to  [DPHY440 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn65dphy440ss.pdf)  *8.2.2
Detailed Design Procedure* for an appropriate adaption via R1 thru R8.

	The output pins automatically compensate for uneven skew between clock and data lanes received on its 
	inputs ports. The DPHY440 output voltage swing and edge rate can be adjusted by changing the state of
	the VSADJ_CFG0 pin and ERC pin respectively.


Populate Q1 (DMG1024), R5 (2k) and R7 (2k) to enable I2C.

## Raspberry Pi 5 Connectors

On The Raspberry Pi 5 board, the connector name labels J3 and J4 are not used as Pin 1 location indicators. 
- Note RPi 5 J3 and J4 Pin 1 locations are on the inward facing side of the ZIF FPC connectors.
- Orient CSI2-SPY-22 based on the Pin 1 and Pin 22 markings on the board.
- Use a **same-side 22-pin 0.5mm** pitch flex print cable to connect the CSI2-SPY-22 board HOST side to RPi 5 CAM/DISP headers.
- Erroenous connection (with an opposite-side flex print cable) will either lead to a disconnected state or the RPi 5 3.3V power rail will be shorted to GND.
